== Class ==
In order to patch a class, we will import everything from the file
>>> from pywikibot.page import *

Now we can refer to class "Page", "User", ... which are in file page.py

If we need to use our own functions, also import init and wp
>>> import init
>>> import wp

Write any function that we want to patch with the same name but has underscore character as the prefix
>>> def _change_category(...)

After implementing functions, map the new functions with the old functions
>>> Page.change_category = _change_category

== Function ==
In order to patch functions without class encapsulating it, we will import everything from the file and import the file itself
>>> import pywikibot.textlib
>>> from pywikibot.textlib import *

Follow the same process as that when we edit a class
>>> import init # optional
>>> import wp # optional
>>> def _getLanguageLinks(...)

Map the new function to functions both in file and outside file
>>> pywikibot.textlib.getLanguageLinks = _getLanguageLinks # Use inside textlib.py
>>> pywikibot.getLanguageLinks = _getLanguageLinks # Use outside textlib.py
